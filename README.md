# CS340-Portfolio

# Overview
This repository contains my final dashboard code and README documentation from Project Two of the SNHU CS 340 Client/Server Development course. The goal of this project was to create a Python-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) module to interact with a MongoDB database and then integrate that module into a Dash-based dashboard application. The dashboard retrieves animal rescue data, filters it according to various categories (such as rescue type), and displays it interactively. This submission represents a culmination of the work done in both Project One and Project Two.

# Reflection
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Throughout the development of the CRUD Python module, I focused on clean code principles, meaningful variable names, and clear documentation. By encapsulating database operations (inserting, querying, updating, deleting) in one dedicated module, I created a layer of abstraction that simplifies interaction with the database. This design made the code more maintainable, as changes to the database logic could be made in a single, centralized place without affecting the rest of the codebase. The improved readability came from consistent formatting, inline comments explaining complex logic, and function docstrings that described expected inputs and outputs. Adaptability was enhanced by structuring the code to be easily extended or integrated with new database queries or additional data sources. Working in this way provided a strong foundation for the dashboard’s backend, streamlining the process of connecting front-end widgets and filters to dynamic backend queries. In the future, this CRUD module could be repurposed for other projects—any scenario requiring MongoDB interactions could simply reuse or adapt this module.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
My approach to the database and dashboard requirements began with clearly understanding the client’s (Grazioso Salvare’s) needs. From there, I broke down the problem into discrete components: designing the database schema, creating efficient queries, building a CRUD abstraction layer, and finally connecting that to a graphical dashboard front-end. Compared to previous assignments in other courses, this project required a more holistic view—thinking end-to-end from data persistence through data visualization. I relied on iterative testing and incremental improvements, starting with basic operations and gradually adding complexity. In the future, I would continue to use a layered approach—first ensuring robust and generic CRUD functionality, then layering on specific business logic and user interface elements. This systematic approach ensures that databases meet client needs and remain flexible for future growth.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design systems that transform raw data into meaningful insights, enabling organizations to make better, data-driven decisions. In the case of Grazioso Salvare, the dashboard created with this project helps them efficiently explore their animal rescue data, identify trends, and optimize their operations. By filtering and visualizing data geographically and categorically, the dashboard supports more informed decision-making about resource allocation, rescue strategies, and training focus. This work matters because it helps companies deliver services more effectively and can have real-world impacts—saving time, resources, and ultimately improving outcomes. The role of a computer scientist extends beyond writing code; it involves problem-solving, critical thinking, and designing systems that can evolve alongside business and technological changes.
